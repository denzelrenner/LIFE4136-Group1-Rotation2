# LIFE4136_Group1_Rotation2
This repositry contained all the Scripts and data needed to reproduce results from group1 in rotation2 of the groupwork projects.

### What is the problem we have been presented with?
We have been provided with some genes in cochaleria 

### What are the aims of our analysis?

### What are the expected outcomes?
We expect to 

### Required files
All these files should be downloaded into the same directory before following the rest of this document.

For replicating results on the cloud :
1)VCFs directory containing {UK_scan_dips.vcf and UK_scan_tets.vcf}
2)Reference_Genome directory containing {C_excelsa_V5_braker2_wRseq.gff3, C_excelsa_V5.fasta and C_excelsa_V5.fasta.fai}

For replicating results from your local machine

# THE BEGINNING 

The first thing we will do is get consensus sequences for our diploids and tetraploids. From this, using the gene cooridnates given in the
